								<h2>Background</h2>
								<blockquote><p>Social workers are nurturers. However, they spend their days so focused on taking care of others that they often forget about their own mental and emotional health. They also work many late nights and have one of the highest burn-out rates due to their high-stress jobs.</p>

								<p>C [ A I ] R E  is an app designed to help social workers improve self-care. Through scheduling, community, and mindfulness activities, social workers are encouraged to integrate more self-care into their everyday lives.</p></blockquote>
								<h2>Research</h2>
								<p>We each interviewed workers in and around the social work industry. Our questions focused on their typical work days and helped us better understand our user by comparing and contrasting details like tasks, pain points, and current use of technology. Some of our most insightful findings include:

								<li>Workers are incredibly motivated by giving back to their community and helping clients receive justice</li>
								<li>Workers manage their own schedules and keep track of their own duties, which creates a tendency of being overworked and causes high burn-out rates</li>
								<li>Handling sensitive cases inflicts emotional burden on workers</li>
								<li>An unpredictable schedule is not uncommon as emergent referrals pop up frequently</li>

								<p>With these insights, we were able to create the following tools to help inform our project:</p>

								<span class="image right"><img src="images/318persona.jpg" alt="" /></span><h4>Persona</h4>

								<p>After researching our user, we created personas to evoke empathy throughout the rest of the design process. We created these personas by drawing information directly from our interviews (attached above), making sure to include both joys and pains that interviewees expressed. We iterated on these documents to create as close to a realistic interpretation of our user group as possible.</p>


								<span class="image right"><img src="images/user experience map_edited.jpg" alt="" /></span><h4>Journey Map</h4>
								
								<p>To get a better understanding of a user's day, we used information from interviews and our personas to create a user journey map. We created this map in order to reveal pleasures and pain points, and consequently reveal design opportunities. Our map of a child social worker's day highlights the fluctuation of motivations and stressors that result from their busy and dynamic day.</p>

								<h2>Design</h2>
								<p>Based on our research, we had to make some critical decisions on how we wanted our solution to behave, operate, and feel. This is an important step because with each design requirement we need to understand when, where, how, and why the user will complete it. If we find that we are missing any of these parts, the design requirement might not be as crucial to our user as we first believed. Some key requirements include allowing users to keep track of emergent cases, receive notifications about completing mindfulness activities, and allowing the AI system to give schedule suggestions. Below is the Information Architecture we drafted based on our insights and goals for our user.</p>
