								<h2>some more about me</h2>
								<p>Hello again! I am in my final year at the University of Washington, where I am a first-generation college student. I am a people-watcher by nature, which I believe has led me to my passions in research. My projects are motivated by my belief that humans should be empowered by technology, and that there is so much left to learn about its place in our lives. Engineering and design is so much more than its productâ€“ it is it's impact. I strive to understand humans, behaviors, and their relationships to technology and how we can design for improvement.</p>
<p>Outside of work and school, I am President of UW Society of Women Engineers and have previously served as VP of Public Relations where I rebranded our club's social presence to make the university's largest student organization feel a little closer. Is your company interested in sponsoring our 300+ member club in the name of inclusivity and diversity? Visit <a href="http://uwswe.com">uwswe.com </a> and email me (-: </p>

<p>And outside of all of this, although I'm not exactly consistent with hobbies, I love hiking (ask me about my favorite hikes!), cooking (maybe more for the eating), running (I just ran my first half marathon!), and finding stray cats...</p>
