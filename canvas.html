								<h2>Background</h2>
								<blockquote><p>For our project we partnered with UW Continuum College, an organization within UW dedicated to providing educational programs to meet the needs of all types of students. They tasked us with optimizing UW’s current learning management system (LMS), Canvas to better integrate online tools in order to provide a seamless and encouraging learning environment for students. Here, we explore the concept of expanding the scope of Canvas to encompass more than just grades, discussions, and quizzes and actually design learning modules for online course content.</p>

								<p>RQ: How can we decrease the cognitive load of students taking online courses through Canvas and design better content learning modules using H5P, an interactive HTML library?</p></blockquote>
								<h2>Motivation & User Group</h2>


								Our work is motivated by the thousands of people who enroll in the UW continuum college’s programs to not only help them create a better opportunity for themselves, but also become lifelong learners. Even though our scope is only on Summer Quarter students, we believe that our designs could have the potential to optimize the learning experience on Canvas, but other Learning Management Systems as well.

								Besides our primary motivation, our team has used Canvas for online classes and hope to create a better learning experience for our fellow students through reducing the cognitive load of using multiple integrated tools. From personal experience and research from the UW Continuum College, there is a problem with the integration of software across courses. For example, with multiple modular learning programs such as MasteringPhysics and Aleks, it’s difficult for students to keep track of everything. Students taking both physics and chemistry have to do their online learning on the respective software and keep track of their grades in Canvas. We aim to address this problem space and take a deep dive into how we can improve the overall online learning experience for students.

								<p>The primary user group that we have outlined for this project are students enrolled in the Summer Quarter program. Secondary users that we have identified are instructors and instructional designers. The tertiary users would be the vendors and specialists of H5P who help with the integration of H5P within Canvas. Our user groups were defined with assistance from our sponsor, who identified several characteristics of our primary and secondary users.

<section>

<b>Research</b><p>First, we conducted a brief literature review, which can be found in our project proposal. From this initial research, our team found studies involving LMS metrics and optimization and research on cognitive load for web design, but did not find a research study that combined both topics. With this in mind, our capstone project serves as a new addition to the research space of LMS by examining the cognitive load of such systems with a human-centered approach rather than a metric-based one.

	Utilizing insights from our review, we brainstormed potential solutions to solve for key business and user requirements to generate concrete and viable options that we could potentially design for. We will dissect our design requirements and translate them into “How might we” questions. These questions serve as prompts for us to generate as many possibilities to solve for our design requirements. After completing our generative brainstorming sessions, we needed to narrow down our ideas into concrete potential workflows. In order to accomplish this, we utilized our “how might we” questions and voted on the top 5 ideas that were the best prospective solutions as indicated below:
	<li>Avatar Based Gamification</li>
	<li>General Gamification with achievements/competition/rewards</li>
  <li>Instant Messaging</li>
  <li>Study Groups</li>
  <li>Stack Overflow Q/A</li>

These ideas were then further evaluated through Informal Concept Testing.
From there, we created user flows depicting the major interactions that our user will have within the platform. With our design requirements and potential solutions, we then translated them into three major user flows, first on whiteboards then on Figma. These flows depict the major actions the student undertakes when interacting with the platform and our proposed content modules. 

</section>

								<h2>User Testing</h2>
								
								We did multiple rounds of user testing, first to understand student experiences with canvas, then to test responses to our ideated concepts, and finally to evaluate our interactive design. Throughout, our partcipant qualifications were:

								<li> <b>Participants should be former or current University of Washington (UW) students. </b>Canvas itself is an LMS utilized by many universities, each with customized experiences. For our project, we are looking specifically to understand UW Canvas.</li>
								<li> <b>Participants have used Canvas for a college-level course. </b>To gather the most relevant insights, participants need to have experience using Canvas with a college course.</li>
								<li> <b>Participants have experience taking an online college-level course.</b> As we sought to evaluate students’ experiences and cognitive load with online learning, it was necessary for students to be experienced in an online course environment.</li>

Findings
From informal concept testing, our results showed that participants were most interested in seeing us incorporate study groups, instant messaging, and/or stack overflow into canvas. From here, we created user flows for each proposed feature and presented them to our advisor, Regina, to further refine our scope. From this presentation, we used the feedback to focus on study groups which we designed wireframes for.


We finalized our research findings and successfully presented them to our sponsor. We then moved into the ideation and initial design phases for an exploratory redesign of Canvas. This included a round of informal concept testing to help refine what ideas we developed. We then created user flows from our results to inform our low and medium fidelity prototypes.

											<b>QUICK EVALUATIONS</b>

<p>We tested our paper prototype with four participants to see what could be improved when creating wireframes. Although they had no experience with social work, the testing was still valuable because it revealed design and functionality issues.

​​

One main issue was with our use of icons. While some were conventional (such as a home button), the icons associated with the more unique functions of our app - such as a workplace - were often misinterpreted. However for most of the screens, users expressed a high level of comfort or familiarity because the placement of buttons and prompts were similar to other apps.</p>

													<li><a href="images/318eval.pdf" class="button primary">View writeup</a></li>
												</ul>

											<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
											<b>ANNOTATED WIREFRAMES</b>

<p>Using participant feedback on our paper prototype, we proceeded to wireframe our entire system. This was the culmination of our entire process, and it was exciting to bring our ideas to life! Along the way, we discovered it was hard to limit which features to include, but learned that the user should be at the forefront of our priorities, not ourselves. We found it helpful to refer back to documents from our research stage when considering users' needs.</p>

											<b>HIGH FIDELITY MOCK UPS</b>

For the final step of our project, we made high-fidelity mockups of three screens that show the app's core functions. Each of these screens demonstrates how  C [ A I ] R E  promotes self-care:
<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/mockups-actions.png" alt=""/></span></div>

<p>The first is the home page where the user can add an emergent case and receive AI scheduling suggestions; the second is a calendar with AI scheduling suggestions; and the last is the user's health dashboard where they complete mindfulness activities and view their progress.</p>
<br>

<h2> Reflection </h2>

<p>Something we learned was that small decisions add up and can greatly impact the design process later on. An instance of this occurred early on in our project right after user interviews. As we progressed through the user-centered process, some of us found that we needed to ask our users more questions about issues not covered in our first (and only) round of interview questions. This may have been a problem due to the context in which this project was created - a ten-week class in an undergraduate program. Perhaps in the real industry, we could conduct several rounds of user research and even different kinds of research aside from interviews.</p>

​

<p>WHAT WE WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY?<br>
Although we conducted user research at the beginning of our project, real social workers saw no other part of our design process. Their feedback would have been helpful at many times in the project, such as during paper prototyping/evaluation. This was again due to the fact that the project was created in a mere ten-week college course. If we did this project again, we would want to get more input from social workers throughout our design process, not just during research. This would encourage our project to be highly empathetic and user-centered, as it should be.</p>
