Week two kicked into gear with project brainstorming and learning about video coding. I read a lot on different areas of accessibility and HCI to focus on for this summer, and honestly the decision-making was overwhelming. I feel like I have such little experience in this specific category but I'm excited to get started and see how things turn out. 

For video coding, the team met and first brainstormed things to label as kids played the exer-game. After agreeing on ~15 possible categories, we moved onto testing them out on one participant. One participant needs at least one label per category for each ball played during the session-- and there were roughly 60 balls per session... One 18-minute video took over two hours to label! But this should get easier as we get used to the system. We used the free BORIS software to do this, and although it was a comprehensive and convieniently free service, using it came with many bugs. Nonetheless, we will get through the next 30 videos over the course of a month or so to analyze the data which should be exciting.
