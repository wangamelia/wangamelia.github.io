Along with adjusting to life in Iowa City, I spent my first week gathering knowledge and context to an existing research project that I am joining. It surrounds the implications of lack of accessible exercise for blind people, and addresses the issue by developing, designing, and evaluating an exer-game.

I met with my team, which is led by a graduated master's student who is leaving halfway through the summer. I am the only DREU student, but there is one other undergrad my age working with us so we have a lot to learn together!

I am excited to delve more into HCI and computing research through a lens that I haven't really had any experience in. Kyle has done extensive work in accessibility, mainly surrounding blind people, so I am excited for what's to come.
